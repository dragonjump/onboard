<h2>Summary</h2>
<hr />
<p>
    Yao is a front-end engineer who regularly works with Visual Studio Code. He starts his day by reviewing his todo.md
    file, making the necessary code changes, and previewing his work. Afterward, he takes a break to visit engineering
    memes on Reddit for a bit of humor. Finally, he updates his commit with a brief, meme-inspired message.</p>

<h4><br /> Step 2 - Accessing the code <br /> </h4>
<div>
    <p>


        I am working on a front-end website project.
        The Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is open,
        and the project folder is located at `~/poemworld` <br /><br />
        I will be monitoring your progress.<br /><br />

        The website will need be running in dev-mode locally at `http://localhost:3000/`.<br /><br />

        Please open the default terminal preferably <br /><br />
        and run the following command to keep the project in development mode:<br /><br />


        `cd ~/poemworld && sh start.sh`<br /><br />
        I want you to make edits using my running VSCode instance,
        as I will be monitoring your progress.<br /><br />

        After every code change, please preview the website at `http://localhost:3000`.<br /><br />

        For the homepage,
        I would like you to include 
        5 funny poems and set the background color to purple.<br /><br/>
